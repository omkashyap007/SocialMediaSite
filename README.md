Welcome to the Advanced Chat System, a powerful communication platform that allows you to chat with anyone in the world who is logged in. Whether you want to chat publicly or privately, connect with new people, or stay in touch with friends and family, our platform makes it easy and convenient.

## Features

Our chat system comes packed with features to enhance your communication experience, including:

**Public Chat System** : Connect and chat with anyone in the world who is logged in to the application. Choose from multiple chat rooms to join conversations on topics that interest you.

**Private Messaging** : Chat privately with friends you have added on the application. Share confidential information, photos, videos, or just engage in a casual conversation without worrying about others seeing your messages.

**Advanced Profile Management** : Create and update your profile to make it stand out. Add a profile picture, cover photo, bio, and any other information you want others to know about you. You can also find and add friends on the application, create and join groups, and participate in forum discussions.

**Real-time Notification System** : Never miss an important message or notification again. Our real-time notification system keeps you informed about any new messages, friend requests, group invites, or other updates related to your account.

**Advanced Security** : Our application is built with the latest security protocols to ensure that your data is safe and secure. We use Markdown-it to prevent XSS attacks, ensuring that your messages are rendered safely and accurately.
